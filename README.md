# Image-Processing-Project
An application for performing erosion, dilation, opening, and closing operations on black-and-white images. Also detects pixels in a black image that, if turned to white, would result in the black image being split into two or more pieces. For an "Image and Signal Processing" course.

The two base image files (ExampleImage1.png and ConnectedImageExample.png), as well as the resulting images, are very small and are used for testing purposes. They were created and viewed with Piskel, but may be viewed and edited in similar applications.
